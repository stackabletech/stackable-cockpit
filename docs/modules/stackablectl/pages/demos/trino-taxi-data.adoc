[#installation]
== Installation

Please follow the xref:commands/demo.adoc#_install_demo[documentation on how to install a demo]. To put it simply you
just have to run `stackablectl demo install trino-taxi-data`.

== List Deployed Stacklets

To list the installed Stackable services run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl stacklets list
 PRODUCT   NAME         NAMESPACE  ENDPOINTS                                     EXTRA INFOS

[NOTE]
====
When a product instance has not finished starting yet, the service will have no endpoint. Starting all the product
instances might take an considerable amount of time depending on your internet connectivity. In case the product is not
ready yet a warning might be shown.
====

== Inspect Data in S3

The S3 provided by MinIO is used as a persistent storage to store all the data used. You can have a look at the testdata
within the MinIO web interface by opening the given `minio` endpoint `console-http` from your
`stackablectl stacklets list` command output. You have to use the endpoint from your command output, in this case it is
http://172.18.0.3:30503. Open it with your favorite browser.

image::demos/trino-taxi-data/minio_1.png[]

Log in with the username `admin` and password `adminadmin`.

image::demos/trino-taxi-data/minio_2.png[]

Click on the blue button `Browse` on the bucket `demo` and open the folders `ny-taxi-data` -> `raw`.

image::demos/trino-taxi-data/minio_3.png[]

As you can see the demo uploaded 1GB of parquet files, one file per month. The data contain taxi rides in New York City.
You can see the file size (and therefore the number of rides) decrease drastically because of the Covid-19 pandemic
starting from `2020-03`. {parquet}[Parquet] is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient
data storage and retrieval.

== Use Trino Web Interface

Trino offers SQL access to the data within S3. Open the `trino` endpoint `coordinator-https` in your browser
(`https://172.18.0.3:30141` in this case). If you get a warning regarding the self signed certificate (e.g.
`Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead`) you have to tell your browser to trust the website and continue.

image::demos/trino-taxi-data/trino_1.png[]

Log in with the username `admin` and password `adminadmin`.

image::demos/trino-taxi-data/trino_2.png[]

When you start executing SQL queries you will see the queries getting processed here.

== Use Superset Web Interface

Superset gives the ability to execute SQL queries and build dashboards. Open the `superset` endpoint `external-superset`
in your browser (`http://172.18.0.4:32295` in this case).

image::demos/trino-taxi-data/superset_1.png[]

Log in with the username `admin` and password `adminadmin`.

image::demos/trino-taxi-data/superset_2.png[]

=== View the Dashboard

On the top click on the tab `Dashboards`.

image::demos/trino-taxi-data/superset_3.png[]

Click on the dashboard called `Taxi data`. It might take some time until the dashboards renders all the included charts.

image::demos/trino-taxi-data/superset_4.png[]

You can clearly see the impact of Covid-19 on the taxi business.

=== Execute Arbitrary SQL Statements

Within Superset you can not only create dashboards but also run arbitrary SQL statements. On the top click on the tab
`SQL Lab` -> `SQL Editor`.

image::demos/trino-taxi-data/superset_5.png[]

On the left select the database `Trino`, the schema `demo` and set `See table schema` to `ny_taxi_data`.

image::demos/trino-taxi-data/superset_6.png[]

On the right textbox enter the desired SQL statement. If you do not want to make on up you can use the following:

[source,sql]
----
select
  format_datetime(tpep_pickup_datetime, 'YYYY/MM') as month,
  count(*) as trips,
  sum(total_amount) as sales,
  avg(duration_min) as avg_duration_min
from ny_taxi_data
group by 1
order by 1
----

image::demos/trino-taxi-data/superset_7.png[]

== Summary

The demo loaded 2.5 years of taxi trip data from New York City with 68 million records and a total size of 1GB in
parquet files. The data was put into the S3 storage. Trino enables you to query the data via SQL. Superset was used as
a web-based frontend to execute SQL statements and build dashboards.

== Where to go from here

There are multiple paths to go from here. The following sections can give you some ideas on what to explore next.
You can find the description of the taxi data {nyc-website}[on the New York City website].

=== Execute Arbitrary SQL Statements

Within Superset you can execute arbitrary SQL statements to explore the taxi data. Can you answer the following
questions by executing SQL statements? The {trino-language-docs}[Trino documentation on their SQL language] might help
you.

How many taxi trips there where in the year 2021?

.See the answer
[%collapsible]
====

[source,sql]
----
select
  count(*) as trips
from ny_taxi_data
where year(tpep_pickup_datetime) = 2021
----

returns 30.903.982 trips.
====

What was the maximum amount of passengers?

.See the Answer
[%collapsible]
====

[source,sql]
----
select
  max(passenger_count) as max_passenger_count
from ny_taxi_data;
----

Returns `112` passengers. Well that's weird. Let's examine the passengers distribution.

[source,sql]
----
select
  passenger_count,
  count(*) as frequency
from ny_taxi_data
group by 1
order by 1 desc
limit 100
----

returns

[source]
----
 passenger_count | frequency
-----------------+-----------
           112.0 |         1
            96.0 |         1
             9.0 |        98
             8.0 |       156
             7.0 |       229
             6.0 |   1089568
             5.0 |   1715439
             4.0 |   1052834
             3.0 |   2504112
             2.0 |   9575299
             1.0 |  48133494
             0.0 |   1454268
            NULL |   2698591
----

We can see that one trip had 112 and another one 96 passengers. All the other trips start with a more "realistic" number
of 9 passengers. As a bonus question: What *exactly* did the large number of passenger do?

[source,sql]
----
select *
from ny_taxi_data
where passenger_count > 50
----

returns

[source]
----
 vendorid |  tpep_pickup_datetime   |  tpep_dropoff_datetime  | duration_min | passenger_count | trip_distance | payment_type | fare_amount | tip_amount | total_amount
----------+-------------------------+-------------------------+--------------+-----------------+---------------+--------------+-------------+------------+--------------
        2 | 2021-08-01 19:47:43.000 | 2021-08-01 19:57:54.000 |           10 |           112.0 |           1.8 | Credit card  |         9.0 |       2.46 |        14.76
        2 | 2021-08-03 11:51:58.000 | 2021-08-03 12:09:29.000 |           17 |            96.0 |          1.56 | Credit card  |        11.5 |       2.22 |        17.02

Pretty cheap for that amount of people! This probably are invalid records.
====

What was the highest tip (measured in percentage of the original fee) ever given?

.See the Answer
[%collapsible]
====

[source,sql]
----
select
  total_amount as fee,
  tip_amount as tip,
  tip_amount / total_amount * 100 as tip_percentage
from ny_taxi_data
where total_amount > 0
order by 3 desc
limit 5
----

returns

[source]
----
 fee  | tip  |   tip_percentage
------+------+--------------------
  4.2 | 10.0 |  238.0952380952381
 18.2 | 25.0 | 137.36263736263737
 8.24 | 9.24 | 112.13592233009709
 0.66 | 0.66 |              100.0
 0.01 | 0.01 |              100.0

=== Create Additional Dashboards

You also have the possibility to create additional charts and bundle them together in a Dashboard. Have a look at
{superset-docs}[the Superset documentation] on how to do that.

=== Load Additional Data

You can use the MinIO webinterface to upload additional data. As an alternative you can use the S3 API with an S3 client
like https://s3tools.org/s3cmd[s3cmd]. It is recommended to put the data into a folder (prefix) in the `demo` bucket.

Have a look at the defined tables inside the `hive`.`demo` schema on how to inform Trino about the newly available data.

.Table Definitions
[%collapsible]
====

[source,sql]
----
show create table hive.demo.ny_taxi_data_raw
----

produces something like

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS hive.demo.ny_taxi_data_raw (
  VendorID BIGINT,
  tpep_pickup_datetime TIMESTAMP,
  tpep_dropoff_datetime TIMESTAMP,
  passenger_count DOUBLE,
  trip_distance DOUBLE,
  payment_type BIGINT,
  Fare_amount DOUBLE,
  Tip_amount DOUBLE,
  Total_amount DOUBLE
) WITH (
  external_location = 's3a://demo/ny-taxi-data/raw/',
  format = 'parquet'
)
----

If you want to transform or filter your data in any way before using it e.g. in Superset you can create a view as
follows:

[source,sql]
----
show create view hive.demo.ny_taxi_data
----

produces something like

[source,sql]
----
create or replace view hive.demo.ny_taxi_data as
select
  vendorid,
  tpep_pickup_datetime,
  tpep_dropoff_datetime,
  date_diff('minute', tpep_pickup_datetime, tpep_dropoff_datetime) as duration_min,
  passenger_count,
  trip_distance,
  case payment_type when 1 then 'Credit card' when 2 then 'Cash' when 3 then 'No charge' when 4 then 'Dispute' when 6 then 'Voided trino' else 'Unknown' end as payment_type,
  fare_amount,
  tip_amount,
  total_amount
from hive.demo.ny_taxi_data_raw
where tpep_pickup_datetime >= from_iso8601_timestamp('2019-12-01T00:00:00')
and tpep_pickup_datetime <= from_iso8601_timestamp('2022-05-31T00:00:00')
----

=== Connect to Trino via CLI, Python or DBeaver

If you prefer running your SQL statements via command-line, a Python script or a graphical Database manager like DBeaver
please have a look at the {trino-client-docs}[the Trino documentation] on how to do that.

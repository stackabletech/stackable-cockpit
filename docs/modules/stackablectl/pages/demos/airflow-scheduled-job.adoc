= airflow-scheduled-job

This demo will

* Install the required Stackable operators
* Spin up the follow data products
** *Postgresql*: An open-source database used for Airflow cluster- and job-metadata.
** *Redis*: An in-memory data structure store used for queuing Airflow jobs
** *Airflow*: An open-source workflow management platform for data engineering pipelines.
* Mount two Airflow jobs (referred to as Directed Acyclic Graphs, or DAGs) for the cluster to use
* Enable and schedule the jobs
* Verify the job status with the Airflow Webserver UI

You can see the deployed products as well as their relationship in the following diagram:

[#system-requirements]
== System requirements

To run this demo, your system needs at least:

* 2.5 https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/resource-metrics-pipeline/#cpu[cpu units] (core/hyperthread)
* 9GiB memory
* 24GiB disk storage

[#installation]
== Installation

Please follow the xref:commands/demo.adoc#_install_demo[documentation on how to install a demo].
To put it simply you just have to run `stackablectl demo install airflow-scheduled-job`.

== List deployed Stackable services

To list the installed Stackable services run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl stacklets list
┌──────────┬───────────────┬───────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┐

[NOTE]
====
When a product instance has not finished starting yet, the service will have no endpoint. Starting all the product
instances might take a considerable amount of time depending on your internet connectivity. In case the product is not
ready yet a warning might be shown.

== Airflow Webserver UI

Superset gives the ability to execute SQL queries and build dashboards. Open the `airflow` endpoint `webserver-airflow`
in your browser (`http://172.18.0.2:31979` in this case).

image::demo-airflow-scheduled-job/airflow_1.png[]

Log in with the username `admin` and password `adminadmin`. The overview screen shows the DAGs that have been mounted
during the demo set-up (`date_demo`).

image::demo-airflow-scheduled-job/airflow_2.png[]

There are two things to notice here. Both DAGs have been enabled, as shown by the slider to the left of the DAG name
(DAGs are initially all `paused` and can be activated either manually in the UI or via a REST call, as done in the setup
for this demo):

image::demo-airflow-scheduled-job/airflow_3.png[]

Secondly, the `date_demo` job has been busy, with several runs already logged! The `sparkapp_dag` has only been run
once. This is because they have been defined with different schedules.

image::demo-airflow-scheduled-job/airflow_4.png[]

Clicking on the number under `Runs` will display the individual job runs:

image::demo-airflow-scheduled-job/airflow_5.png[]

The `demo_date` job is running every minute. With Airflow, DAGs can be started manually or scheduled to run when certain
conditions are fulfilled: in this case the DAG has been set up to run using a cron table, which is part of the DAG
definition.

=== `demo_date` DAG

Let's drill down a bit deeper into this DAG. Click on one of the individual job runs shown in the previous step to
display the job details. The DAG is displayed in the form of a graph (this job is so simple that it only has one step,
called `run_every_minute`).

image::demo-airflow-scheduled-job/airflow_6.png[]

In the top right-hand corner there is some scheduling information, which tells us that this job will run every minute
continuously:

image::demo-airflow-scheduled-job/airflow_7.png[]

Click on the `run_every_minute` box in the centre of the page and then select `Log`:

image::demo-airflow-scheduled-job/airflow_8.png[]

This will navigate to the worker where this job was run (with multiple workers the jobs will be queued and distributed
to the next free worker) and display the log. In this case the output is a simple printout of the timestamp:

image::demo-airflow-scheduled-job/airflow_9.png[]

To look at the actual DAG code click on `Code`. Here we can see the crontab information used to schedule the job as well
the `bash` command that provides the output:

image::demo-airflow-scheduled-job/airflow_10.png[]

=== `sparkapp_dag` DAG

Go back to DAG overview screen. The `sparkapp_dag` job has a scheduled entry of `None` and a last-execution time
(`2022-09-19, 07:36:55`). This allows a DAG to be executed exactly once, with neither schedule-based runs nor any
https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/dag-run.html?highlight=backfill#backfill[backfill]. The DAG can
always be triggered manually again via REST or from within the Webserver UI.

image::demo-airflow-scheduled-job/airflow_11.png[]

By navigating to the graphical overview of the job we can see that DAG has two steps, one to start the job - which runs
asynchronously - and another to poll the running job to report on its status.

image::demo-airflow-scheduled-job/airflow_12.png[]

The logs for the first task - `spark-pi-submit` - indicate that it has been started, at which point the task exits
without any further information:

image::demo-airflow-scheduled-job/airflow_13.png[]

The second task - `spark-pi-monitor` - polls this job and waits for a final result (in this case: `Success`). In this
case, the actual result of the job (a value of `pi`) is logged by Spark in its driver pod, but more sophisticated jobs
would persist this in a sink (e.g. a Kafka topic or HBase row) or use the result to trigger subsequent actions.

== Summary

This demo showed how DAGs can be made available for Airflow, scheduled, run and then inspected with the Webserver UI.

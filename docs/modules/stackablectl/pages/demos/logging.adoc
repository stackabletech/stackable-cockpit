This demo will

* Install the required Stackable operators.
* Spin up the follow data products:
** *Apache ZooKeeper*: A centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed
   synchronization, and providing group services. This demo makes its log data observable in OpenSearch Dashboards.
** *Vector*: A tool for building observability pipelines. This demo uses Vector as a log agent to gather and transform
   the logs and as an aggregator to forward the collected logs to OpenSearch.
** *OpenSearch*: A data store and search engine. This demo uses it to store and index the log data.
** *OpenSearch Dashboards*: A visualization and user interface. This demo uses it to make the log data easily accessible
   to the user.
* Create a view in OpenSearch Dashboards for convenient browsing the log data.

You can see the deployed products as well as their relationship in the following diagram:

== OpenSearch Prerequisites

=== MacOS and Windows

If you are running on Mac or Windows and use Docker to run Kubernetes then set the RAM to at least 4 GB in
_Preferences_ > _Resources_.

=== Linux

OpenSearch uses a mmapfs directory by default to store its indices. The default operating system limits on mmap counts
is likely to be too low - usually 65530, which may result in out of memory exceptions. So the Linux setting
`vm.max_map_count` on the host machine where kind is running, must be set to at least 262144.

To check the current value, run this command:

[source,console]
----
sysctl vm.max_map_count
----

The limit can be temporarily increased with:

[source,console]
----
sudo sysctl --write vm.max_map_count=262144
----

To permanently increase the value, add the following line to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

[source,.properties]
----
vm.max_map_count=262144
----

Then run `sudo sysctl --load` to reload.

[#system-requirements]
== System requirements

To run this demo, your system needs at least:

* 6.5 {k8s-cpu}[cpu units] (core/hyperthread)
* 5GiB memory
* 27GiB disk storage

[#installation]
== Installation

Please follow the xref:commands/demo.adoc#_install_demo[documentation on how to install a demo]. To put it simply you
just have to run `stackablectl demo install logging`.

== List Deployed Stacklets

To list the installed Stackable services run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl stacklets list

[NOTE]
====
When a product instance has not finished starting yet, the service will have no endpoint. Starting all the product
instances might take a considerable amount of time depending on your internet connectivity. In case the product is not
ready yet, a warning might be shown.

== Inspect the Log Data

You can have a look at the log data within the OpenSearch Dashboards web interface by running
`stackablectl stacklets list` and opening the URL shown in the info column of the `opensearch-dashboards` entry. In this
case it is http://172.18.0.5:31319/app/discover?security_tenant=global#/view/logs.

Log in with the username `admin` and password `adminadmin`.

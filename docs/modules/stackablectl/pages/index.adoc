= stackablectl

The `stackablectl` command line tool is used to interact with the Stackable data platform. It can install individual
operators as well as platform releases. It also ships with a set of pre-built xref:commands/demo.adoc[`demo`] that
utilize different data products of the Platform to get e.g. an end-to-end data pipeline.

The installation of `stackablectl` is described in xref:installation.adoc[]. To just get started, please follow
xref:quickstart.adoc[].

In general, use `stackablectl --help` to find out more about how to use the tool or how to use specific options. This
also works with subcommands, i.e. `stackablectl release install --help` will show the help for installing a release.
Often you can also use an abbreviation instead of typing out all of the commands. E.g. `stackablectl operator list` can
also be written as `stackablectl op ls`

A Kubernetes cluster is required in order to use the Stackable Data Platform as all products and operators run on
Kubernetes. If you don't have a Kubernetes cluster, `stackablectl` can spin up a https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind]
Kubernetes Cluster for you.

The deployed services are separated into three different layers as illustrated below:

image::layers.png[Layers of the deployed services]

== Operators

This layer consists of Stackable operators managing the individual data products. They can either be installed one by
one with the xref:commands/operator.adoc[`operator`] command or from a release with the
xref:commands/release.adoc[`release`] command which is recommended way. A release is a well-playing bundle of operators
that has been extensively tested by Stackable.

== Stacks

A stack is a collection of ready-to-use Stackable data products as well as needed third-party services like Postgresql
or MinIO.

Stacks are installed with the xref:commands/stack.adoc[`stack`] command. A stack needs a release (of Stackable
operators) to run on. To achieve this a stacks has a dependency on a release which gets automatically installed when a
stack is installed.

== Demos

A demo is an end-to-end demonstration of the usage of the Stackable data platform. It contains:

. Installing a Stackable release
. Spinning up a stack
. Performing the actual demo
.. Prepare some test data
.. Process test data
.. Visualize results (optional)

Demos are installed with the xref:commands/demo.adoc[`demo`] command. A demo needs a stack to run on. To achieve this a
demo has a dependency on a stack which gets automatically installed when a demo is installed. The stack in turn will
install the needed Stackable release.

You can browse the available demos xref:demos/index.adoc[on the demo page]. We currently offer the following list of

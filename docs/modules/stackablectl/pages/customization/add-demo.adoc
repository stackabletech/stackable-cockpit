= Add a Demo

== Motivation

When you have developed a new data pipeline or data product you often want to show it in action to other colleagues or
potential clients. To easily achieve this you can create your own demo, so that it can easily be reproduced and/or
shared with other people.

Please keep in mind that a demo requires a stack to run on. Have a look at the chapter
xref:customization/add-stack.adoc[] on how to create your own stack.

== 1. Create a demos.yaml

For a custom demo you need to create a `mycorp-demos.yaml` containing demos according to the format defined by
https://github.com/stackabletech/stackablectl/blob/main/demos/demos-v1.yaml[the Stackable provided demos].

As of writing a `demos.yaml` file could look as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
demos:
  mycorp-warehouse-realtime-analysis:
    description: Using our internal warehouse stack we show how you can analyze real-time data and build interactive Dashboards
    documentation: https://my.corp/some-blogpost-anouncing-demo.html
    stackableStack: mycorp-warehouse
    labels:
      - mycorp
      - warehouse
      - real-time
      - dashboards
    manifests:
      - plainYaml: https://my.corp/demos/mycorp-warehouse-realtime-analysis/create-testdata-ingestion-job.yaml
      - plainYaml: https://my.corp/demos/mycorp-warehouse-realtime-analysis/create-trino-tables.yaml
      - plainYaml: https://my.corp/demos/mycorp-warehouse-realtime-analysis/setup-superset.yaml
----

== 2. Using the Custom `demos.yaml` File

After creating the `mycorp-demos.yaml` file it can be added to the available demos in `stackablectl` via the CLI
argument `--demo-file mycorp-demos.yaml`.

The argument to `--demo-file` can be either a path to a file on the local filesystem or an URL. By using an URL the
demos file can be put into a central Git repository and referenced by all teams or clients. Multiple `--demo-file` flags
can be specified to include multiple demos files.

Additionally, the custom file can be provided using environment variable. The variable can be defined by using `export`
in the shell or a `.env` file.

[source,ini]
----
STACKABLECTL_DEMO_FILES=demos1.yml,demos2.yml
----

Every additional demo will be added to the already existing demos in `stackablectl`, so all the available demos files
will be merged.

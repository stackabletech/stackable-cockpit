== 1.2.2

* Add the option for users to customize the behaviour of `stackablectl` through a user config located at `$HOME/.config/stackablectl/config.toml`.
  The first supported option is `version.check_enabled` which can be set to `true` or `false`.
  See https://github.com/stackabletech/stackable-cockpit/pull/422[stackable-cockpit#422].
* Add a new release check which is used in two different ways:
** A new `stackablectl version check` command can be used to check if the current installation is up-to-date
** A check automatically runs for all other commands (in parallel to not block the commands) and the status is reported as part of the final command output.
